$ 1.2.3
  % Version 1.2.3
    _2012-05-18
	* Fixed issue where Known tag was not shown when browsing class spells. 
	
$ 1.2.2
  % Version 1.2.2
    _2012-05-17
    * Reworked layout for list header in Class Spells view and Prepared Spells view for better compability with smaller screens.
	* Class Spells header now also shows what class is currently being browsed. 
	
$ 1.2.1
  % Version 1.2.1
    _2012-05-12
    * Major back end refactoring done to database classes to make way for future features. Should lower risk of issues in the long run. 
	* Added a new Spellbook icon that better reflects what the app is all about.
	* Bugfix: Will now create a Default character if no other characters exist. This character can be edited as normal with a long-click. 
	* Known Issue: Hard to track down bug where class changes are sometimes not taken into account when Known spells are used. Killing app and restarting is a temporary work-around. Apologies.
$ 1.1.2
  % Version 1.1.2
    _2012-04-15
    * File reorganization, should now properly place files on the SD card. Unfortunately, this change might cause loss of characters. I apologize for this, but I felt the need to fix the below issues were too great.
    * I recommend backing up your characters to file if you have highlvl characters or characters that require time to rememorize.
    * On todo-list is a secondary redundant backup of characters to xml file on app close, if the database should keep being problematic. 
    * Added Spell Source book to Single-Spell view. This is first step toward excluding/including specific source books. 
    * Fixed issue where characters may have been deleted on Update. Character database is now stored in a public directory called spelldirectory.  
    * Fixed issue where not having any known spells could cause a crash on character restore.
$ 1.1.1
  % Version 1.1.1
    _2012-04-14
    * Hopefully fixed bug where class was not changed properly after leaving the device alone a while (hard to track down, I hope I have it fixed). 
    * Fixed bug where daily spell uses left were not retrieved correctly on character restore. Re-restoring a previously backed up char will properly restore daily uses.
$ 1.1.0
  % Version 1.1.0 (Known Spells)
    _2012-04-08
    * Known Spells is in as a user-definable class. See Help for more info about usage. 
	* With this new class, Wizards need no longer look through the whole list, and others can use the class to save favorite spells. 
	* Longclick Mode option has been added to spell list menu to accommodate the new known spells functionality.
	* LongClick mode now defaults to Prepare Spell/Use spell mode when entering one of the spell browsing list views.
	* Recent changes dialog has been added. 
	* Back end refactorings for future features.
